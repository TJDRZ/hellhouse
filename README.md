### Turn based escape the killer game vs AI opponent

**Base Game:**

- Top view, turn based game.
- Killer starts at the top on the escape, player starts on the bottom at the back of house.
- Characters can move around into any adjacent room.
- Repeat until player moves up and escapes or runs into the killer and dies

**Future Feature Ideas:**

- Dynamic house sizes. Most likely a small, medium, large prompt to start to avoid overly large room counts.
- Alerts to tell player if killer on an adjacent square. Smarter AI killer, who will use the same.
- Tasks, such as finding a key in a random room prior to escape.
